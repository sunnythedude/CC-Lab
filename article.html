			Manchester United's Paul Pogba "looks like he never left the club," David De Gea says, as the marquee signing returns to Old Trafford after three years with Juventus.
		</p>
		<p>
			Sir Alex Ferguson may have allowed the midfielder to leave the club for next to nothing, but Pogba has now returned following a world-record transfer and could start on Friday against Southampton.
		</p>
		<br>
		<p>
			De Gea says the 23-year-old, who revealed a new hairstyle on Tuesday ahead of his expected debut, feels at "home" in Manchester.
		</p>
		<br>
		<p>
			"I think he is something special. Signing for this club, he played here before and I think he's home," the goalkeeper told MUTV.
		</p>
		<p>
			"He feels like this is his home and we are all really, really happy to have him again in Manchester.
		</p>
		<p>
			"He's now with all his friends again in Manchester, with everyone here, and he looks like he never left the club. He's really good for the team."
		</p>
		<br>
		<p>
			Pogba joins other signings Zlatan Ibrahimovic, Eric Bailly and Henrikh Mkhitaryan  as Manchester United opened the cheque book for new boss Jose Mourinho this summer.

			And De Gea believes the new players have fit right in with the existing United squad.
		</p>
		<p>
			"I think it's good to have a mix of young players and experienced players," De Gea said.
		</p>
		<br>
		<p>
			"That's what we have in the team now and I think it's really good for the young players. They have done really well, they train very hard and<br> it's really good to see."
