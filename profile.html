<p>Viewed as one of the world's top strikers, as well as being one of the most temperamental, Ibrahimovic made a name for himself at Inter Milan and won himself numerous personal awards at the San Siro. Known for his strength, aerial ability and fiery personality, Ibrahimovic has been compared to Dutch legend Marco van Basten for his playing style.</p>
<p>Born to a Bosnian father and a Croatian mother, Ibrahimovic grew up in Sweden and plays for the Swedish national team. He began his career at nearby Malmo FF, before moving to Ajax where he blossomed, but courted controversy in his three years, before he was sold to Juventus.</p>
<p>Caught up in the Calciopoli scandal, Ibrahimovic was relegated to Serie B, but was not keen to stay on in Turin. Moving to Internazionale for £16.7 million, he became a fixture in their three title-winning side and then-boss Jose Mourinho claimed that he was, for him, "the best player in the world, ahead of (Cristiano) Ronaldo" -- although the quote raised some eyebrows.</p>
<p>In 2009, he announced that he would like to seek a new challenge and agreed terms on an incredible swap deal with Samuel Eto'o that would see him become a Barcelona player, signing a five-year deal. His one season at the Nou Camp saw him score goals, but he fell out with coach Pep Guardiola and joined AC Milan on loan in August 2010 where he won another Serie A title.</p>
<p>A starring role at Euro 2012 followed, despite Sweden being knocked out in the group stages, and he then moved to French side PSG in July 2012 for a fee of €20 million. The striker immediately impressed and won three straight titles, two Trophee des champions and Coupe de la Ligue gongs, and one more Coupe de France.</p>
<p>During his time in France, his spectacular bicycle kick for Sweden against England also won the 2013 FIFA Puskas Award for Goal of the Year and, while he could not help his country to the 2014 World Cup, he made his 100th appearance in a UEFA Euro 2016 qualifier against Austria.</p>
